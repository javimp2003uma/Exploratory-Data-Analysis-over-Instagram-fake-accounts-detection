# Exploratory Data Analysis over Instagram fake accounts detection in R

This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Instagram fake accounts detection, including the application of powerful data analysis and visualisation techniques, as well as machine learning models.


The folder "_book" is the one that includes the HTML files, in order to see the precompiled files I have used to create a good looking report. QMD files contain a combination of markdown and executable code cells.
